## 3. Deploy Steps:
### Full Flow of Deploying Backend

#### 1. AWS Console Access and Security Group Configuration

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service.
3. In the left sidebar, under "Network & Security," click on "Security Groups."
4. Find and select the security group associated with your EC2 instance:
5. In the bottom pane, click on the "Inbound rules" tab.
6. Click the "Edit inbound rules" button.
7. Click "Add rule."
8. For the new rule, set the following:
   - Type: SSH
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Port Range: 22
   - Source: Custom
9. In the text box next to "Custom," enter the IP address you want to whitelist. Add "/32" at the end to specify a single IP (e.g., "203.0.113.0/32").
10. (Optional) Add a description for the rule to help you remember why it was added.
11. Click "Save rules" to apply the changes.

#### 2. Connecting to EC2 Instance

1. Request the pem file from developers/admins.
2. Use this command to connect:
```
ssh -i PEM_FILE EC2_IP_ADDRESS
```

#### 3. Accessing Tmux Instances

Once inside the EC2 instance, check for 2 tmux instances:

1. Backend instance (broadcaster deno backend):
   ```
   tmux a -t backend
   ```

2. Lookup instance (address lookup/conversation summary python backend):
   ```
   tmux a -t lookup
   ```
